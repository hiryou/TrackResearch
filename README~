INSTALLATION
------------

- You need to install PHP package on your local box in order to run PHP from
command line
- Copy folder "src" to your workspace and rename it to whatever makes sense for you. 
This contains everthing needed. The script will be executed via src/main.php


USAGE
-----

- Open your terminal and locate to "src" folder. Suppose you are already in src.
- Usage and options:
    $ php main.php -f [from_date] -t [to_date] -u [odin_username] -p
    # You'll be prompted to input your ODIN password securely
    
    -f: From date, in Y-m-d format, e.g. 2012-07-01
    -t: To date, in Y-m-d format, e.g. 2012-12-31
    -u: To input your ODIN username, i.e. without the "@pdx.edu"
    -p: To input your ODIN password. You can just leave this option unspecified
        in order to be prompted for password input


USAGE EXAMPLES
--------------

The current version only support reports for all tickets, i.e. everything you have
been working on will be reported. I'll update it soon to allow you filter by project(s).

Suppose my ODIN username is longuyen. I want to report my working hours from Jul 01,
2012 to Dec 31, 2012. Below is how I'll specify my arguments:
    $ php main.php -f 2012-07-01 -t 2012-12-31 -p -u longuyen
    # You will be asked for password
    
Depend on how many tickets you have on TRACK, the script may take up to 15 minutes
or more to fetch all of them. Detailed statistics will be printed on your terminal.
They are also saved in newly created .txt files which you will find in the this
folder when the script terminates.
