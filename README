INTRODUCTION
------------

This script is designed to help ARC employees report their hours on TRACK more accurately 
and easily (for the mean time until we improve the TRACK system). You can use it to extract 
your total working time in a given time range and being filtered by project name(s). You must 
be an ARC employee with an active ODIN account to use this script.


INSTALLATION
------------

As far as I know, all boxes in ARC office are loaded with necessary prerequisite packages.
If you are on any of them, feel free to skip to step 4. Otherwise, follow the full instruction 
for your local box.

1. Verify php cli (PHP for command line) is installed. From your terminal, execute the 
following command:
    $ php -v
  If you see something like this:
    # PHP 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.5 with Suhosin-Patch (cli) (built: Jan 18 2013 23:40:19) 
    # Copyright (c) 1997-2012 The PHP Group
    # Zend Engine v2.3.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2012 Zend Technologies
  It means you're good to go. Otherwise, proceed to install php cli by running
this command:
    $ sudo apt-get php

2. Verify curl is installed for your php cli:
    $ curl -V
  You should see some info like this:
    # curl 7.22.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.22.0 OpenSSL/1.0.1 zlib/1.2.3.4 
    # libidn/1.23 librtmp/2.3
    # Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap pop3 pop3s 
    # rtmp rtsp smtp smtps telnet tftp 
    # Features: GSS-Negotiate IDN IPv6 Largefile NTLM NTLM_WB SSL libz TLS-SRP
  Otherwise, proceed to get the required curl packages:
    $ sudo apt-get install curl libcurl3 libcurl3-dev php5-curl

3. Restart your XAMPP/Apache server if you have just installed curl

4. Copy folder "src" to your workspace. The complete scripts reside in this folder.


USAGE OVERVIEW
--------------

- Open your terminal and locate to src folder. Suppose you are already in src.
- Synopsis:
    
    $ php main.php -u [odin_username] -f [from_date] -t [to_date] -p [password] -pj [project_names]
    # You'll be prompted to input your ODIN password securely

- Options:
    
    [Required arguments]
    -f: From date, in Y-m-d format, e.g. '2012-07-01' (without quote)
    -t: To date, in Y-m-d format, e.g. '2012-12-31' (without quote)
    -u: Specifies your ODIN username without the "@pdx.edu" part
        
    [Optional arguments]
    -p:  Should be left unspecified to be prompted for secure password typing
    -pj: To filter by project names. Project names must be separated by comma and has no space
         in between. e.g. 'otrec', or 'otrec,capstone,osbit' (no quote). If this is left empty, 
         all your tickets will be fetched.
         
- How to specify correct project names for -pj?
    * Login to track.reserach.pdx.edu with your ODIN account
    * Go to http://track.research.pdx.edu/my
    * Notice the "Filter results" box on the right side. Click the textbox under "Project", you will
      see a list of project names. Btw, you must know your project name(s) better than anyone else! 


USAGE EXAMPLES
--------------

* Suppose my ODIN username is longuyen. I want to report all of my working hours from Jul 01,
2012 to Dec 31, 2012. Below is how I'll specify my arguments:
    $ php main.php -u longuyen -f 2012-07-01 -t 2012-12-31 -p
    # Password prompt
    
* Now I just want to report tickets on OTREC:
    $ php main.php -u longuyen -f 2012-07-01 -t 2012-12-31 -pj otrec
    # Password prompt
    
* To filter for multiple projects, e.g. OTREC, Capstone, and Osbit:
    $ php main.php -u longuyen -f 2012-07-01 -t 2012-12-31 -pj otrec,capstone,osbit
    # Password prompt
    
Depend on how many tickets you have, the script may take up to 5 minutes to fetch them. 
Detailed statistics will be printed on your terminal. They are also saved in the newly 
created .txt files which you will find in the this folder when the script terminates.
