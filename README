INSTALLATION
------------

- Check to see if php cli (PHP for command line) is installed on your box. From
your terminal, execute the following command:
    $ php -v
  If you see something like this:
    # PHP 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.5 with Suhosin-Patch (cli) (built: Jan 18 2013 23:40:19) 
    # Copyright (c) 1997-2012 The PHP Group
    # Zend Engine v2.3.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2012 Zend Technologies
  It means you're good to go. Otherwise, proceed to install php cli by running
this command:
    $ sudo apt-get php
- Check to see if curl is installed for your php cli:
    $ curl -V
  If you see something like this:
    # curl 7.22.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.22.0 OpenSSL/1.0.1 zlib/1.2.3.4 
    # libidn/1.23 librtmp/2.3
    # Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap pop3 pop3s 
    # rtmp rtsp smtp smtps telnet tftp 
    # Features: GSS-Negotiate IDN IPv6 Largefile NTLM NTLM_WB SSL libz TLS-SRP
  Then curl was installed. Otherwise, proceed to get curl packages:
    $ sudo apt-get install curl libcurl3 libcurl3-dev php5-curl
- Restart your XAMPP/Apache server if have you just installed curl
- Copy folder "src" to your workspace and rename it to whatever makes sense for 
you. This contains everthing needed. The script will be executed via src/main.php


USAGE
-----

- Open your terminal and locate to src folder. Suppose you are already in src.
- Usage and options:
    $ php main.php -f [from_date] -t [to_date] -u [odin_username] -p
    # You'll be prompted to input your ODIN password securely
    
    -f: From date, in Y-m-d format, e.g. 2012-07-01
    -t: To date, in Y-m-d format, e.g. 2012-12-31
    -u: To input your ODIN username, i.e. without the "@pdx.edu"
    -p: To input your ODIN password. You can just leave this option unspecified
        in order to be prompted for password input


USAGE EXAMPLES
--------------

The current version only support reports for all tickets, i.e. everything you have
been working on will be reported. I'll update it soon to allow you filter by project(s).

Suppose my ODIN username is longuyen. I want to report my working hours from Jul 01,
2012 to Dec 31, 2012. Below is how I'll specify my arguments:
    $ php main.php -f 2012-07-01 -t 2012-12-31 -p -u longuyen
    # You will be asked for password
    
Depend on how many tickets you have on TRACK, the script may take up to 5 minutes
to fetch all of them. Detailed statistics will be printed on your terminal. They 
are also saved in newly created .txt files which you will find in the this folder 
when the script terminates.
